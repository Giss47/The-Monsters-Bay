Design:

One of the first things we decided was that the program should be divided 
into several classes to abstract the code and make it easier to find 
certain parts in the code. Another reason is to have the ability to create 
objects of a certain class which is the way we went. All of our classes is 
instantiated throughout runtime and this gives us high security in the 
programs structure. We could have let the Cart class be a static 
one since it’s a static part of the program, but we decided to go with a 
non-static one to achieve encapsulation and a high protection level for
data. 

At the start of writing our code, we saved a Static list of products 
directly in MyForm class. This practice was easier to work with, but 
on the other hand we encountered many problems, as the data could be 
easily accessed from any part of the code in our project. Another 
downside was that we used the same list to directly work with the data 
within by other classes, like the Cart class. Which lead us to unexpected
behavior and a frustrating bug. Our Cart operations were changing the 
data within the main objects and it was hard to detect the bug. 
By abstracting both,product object in Class Product and cart object in 
Class CartProduct, along with creating Class data, we could over come
this problem and create a solid and easily mintainable code. 
 
We have relied upon encapsulation through our code by using methods 
where ever we could. In MyForm class, we have created many methods that 
mostly depend on each other. This nestling of methods serves very well 
as an object oriented pattern, and gives the program a solid build up. 
But on the other hand, it made the source code in some areas a little 
bit hard to follow and understand from the first outlook, and in 
some angles, we have wrote more lines of code. As the program is not 
very big, no significant performance issues can be raised by using more
instructions. Gaining reusability and security was, for us, a good choice 
over readability and my minor performance issues in
this project, and has influenced many of our structure and design related 
decisions.
